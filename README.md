> Requirements for a professional website
# Steps
1. Log in to `Github` account
2. Fork this `repository`
3. Think of a *character* other than *Darth Vader*
4. Work **JUST** in Github, by editing the `index.html` file (*TIP*: you could copy and paste from your favorite editor - or let Mr. M. show you how to REALLY use Github - that would take a good bit of time to learn 0 we'll do it later in IMD courses anyways.)
5. Change all links, text, references / images to your character
6. See requirements below

# Netlify to serve up Github pages

- Github can be **SLOW** to update the web view of your HTML (maybe allows less than 10 updates per hour)
- Github is **NOT** slow for making changes

- **Solution**: **Have Netlify.com serve up you repository**
- Sign up to https://netlify.com with your Github credentials (username  / password)
- Example
- https://1000-darth-vader.netlify.com/  (you can change the subdomain to anything you want)

# Favicon - Favorite Icon...

1. Find a .png for your character at least 128x128 pixels (260X260 is recommended)
2. Generate a bunch of icons and the necessary code with https://realfavicongenerator.net
3. Add the code
4. Download all the generated icons
5. add all the icons to your repository - replacing the Darth Vader Icons
6. VERIFY you icon is working with https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker

> IMPORTANT

Since this is not in the root of a domain... you must remove the `/`

`<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="/apple-icon-57x57.png">` wrong

**becomes**

`<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="57x57" href="apple-icon-57x57.png">` correct
